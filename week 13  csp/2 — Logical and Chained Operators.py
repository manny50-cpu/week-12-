# Objective:
# Students will use logical (and, or, not) and chained comparison operators in Python to build compound conditions.

# Key Notes:

# and → Both conditions must be True

# or → At least one condition must be True

# not → Inverts True/False

# You can chain comparisons: 1 < x < 5

# Examples:
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 15)   # True
print(x < 5 or x == 10)   # True
print(not(x == 10))       # False
print(1 < x < 20)         # True


# Practice Problems:

# Write an expression that checks if a number is between 50 and 100 (inclusive).
y= 59
if y>=50 and y<=100:
    print("Yes sir")
else:
    print("No sir")
# Write an expression that checks if a number is NOT equal to 0 and greater than 10.
if y!= 0 and y>=10:
    print("Yes sir")
else:
    print("No sir")
# Use chained comparison to check if 3 < 4 < 5.
x= 5
y=3
z=4
if y<z<x:
    print("yes sir")
else:
    print("No sir")
